# Voyager

View my live project here! [Voyager](https://jonathanwhitedev.github.io/voyager/) 

Voyager is a new website club and newsletter designed to celebrate our unique planet and the thousands of different cultures and traditions each country or territary around the world possesses. This weekly newsletter provides the user with fundamental and educational information on what each country has to offer from inspiration, adventure, travel tips, folklore tales and interviews, religious festivities, amazing food and drinks recipes, and local events. Therefore it remains inclusive for people to be involved without having to travel to featured country. The aim is to provide 1 month of 4 different and vibrant newsletters by sign up, which are emailed to the user to get a varied and informative grasp on each location. These are always fun filled and educational. A new month provides an entirely different and unique country to explore in fabulous detail. Our first month features Iceland.


## User Stories and UX

- __As a visiting user, I would like to signup for the newsletter.__

As part of the UX specification and planning phase it was noted that there are currently no available newsletter websites that offer services to consumers looking for varied inspirational and educational tips of countries around the world in great detail. This was an opening to provide a website that provided a sign up for people. A multitude of people surveyed agreed that there was no website that offered such a vast array of information with a free newsletter, sent weekly via email. This would be something they felt would be a valuable USP. 

- __As a visiting user, I would like to be inspired and educated.__

Over three quarters of those surveyed (100) also came to agreement there was no one place online that provided inspiration for holidays and trips with such great detail on places to visit, sites to see, unique experiencs to enjoy such as festivities, best times of the year to visit with links to external resources such as travel advice provided by goverment bodies etc.

- __As a visiting user, I would inspiration to try at home.__

Another shortfall noticed was that for those who would like to experience a new vibrant culture but were unable to physically travel there, would benefit greatly from recipes and drinks menus and local events happening around the UK that celebrated the culture being displayed for that month. For example Diwali celebrations happening in London, restaurants that serve the most authentic food from that nation with reviews, educational facts and stories of that country that can be read by children and adults alike. Almost all that were surveyed in the UX consulation stage agreed there was no one website that provided all this useful information and more, so readily availabe as Voyager.

- __As a visiting user, I would like concise, clear information.__

Each page on the Voyager website (Home, Spotlight, About, Sign-up and Welcome) keep a clear and modern layout throughout that is accessible for all, gives the user an easy to follow grasp of what the website offers.


## Home Landing Page
Home provides a simple and clean layout with key information on what the website offers "Inspiration. Education. Adventure. From around the world, to your inbox. Weekly".

A large "Voyager" font in modern text in the centre of the page keeps the attracts the user to the modern lines.

## Testing 

Overall, I am very happy with the testing outcomes with lighthouse, HTML, and CSS validation. I was concerned the video backgrounds may have an effect upon this but im glad that choosing short videos with lower quality may have helped my cause with this. I have tested all pages and functions, clickable links of social media links in nav bar as well as buttons, forms, and nav bar buttons. All of these work fast and clean for optimisation for the user to have a streamless experience on the website, all of their goals can be met simply and concisely with straightforward webpages that are engaging.

I have tested this website on a macbook pro with a 32 inch external monitor, an Ipad Pro, and a Iphone 13 pro max. I have also used reponsive design in Google dev tools with other devices such as a Surface Duo, Samsung galaxy devices including the fold, and other smaller devices of 280px max width. These were written with extensive media queries to be inclusive for all users regardless of the device they use.

It is noticed however that video backgrounds do not tend to work on smartphones - my personal iphone 13 pro max for instance. This may be because of the memory usage this website requires, however, i am happy that although the video may not play, a still of the video is still present and does in no way detract from the user experience and all functions still work fast and efficiently.

### Performance Testing

  - No performance issues were returned when passing through the official Lighthouse feature on google chrome dev tools [https://developer.chrome.com/docs/lighthouse/overview/] on all 5 HTML pages of website. Scores of over 90% were present throughout as per following screenshots:

## Credits 

I will firstly credit code institute for the help with this page, the love running project helped me immensely when i found the going tough or needed to remember small details such as how to use social link tags etc. I also want to shout out to the code institute tutors for some help on minor tweaks to point me in directions where i was a little lost and they helped me understand where i was going wrong. Lastly i'd like to thank my dilligent mentor who helped me research other areas such as flexbox and grid, and even told me to start with developing in mobile screens firstly and start backwards from there to desktop. (oh if i had only listened to that last advice, would have saved me so much time!) This was a steep learning curve for me but because of the minor mistakes and not following flex/media at the beginning i learnt the hard way and in turn learnt an awful lot through the stress of it all!

Content and media inspiration is as follows below;

### Content 

- The button anchor tags design sections were taken from finding them on Traversy Media youtube channel and video https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8MgpE2DTTKA&t=1114s these were then redesigned further with colour that was suitable for the page and font/sizes. The same video was also used for finding social li a transform scales to improve look of social icons and pop from page.
- The social icons in the bottom of section of all pages were taken from [Font Awesome](https://fontawesome.com/)
- The webkit stroke function was found after heavy research in needing a solution to allow text to pop off the background to be unique and more readble against the background colours and video content, this was found at (https://css-tricks.com/adding-stroke-to-web-text/) I then incorporated this into my css for my specific needs.

### Media

- All of the videos (5) used on all pages are from This Open Source site (http://pexels.com) these were then resaved as different file names, as text was either in russian or had spaces and would fail testing or reading for other developers.

## Thank you for taking the time to view my README file, hope you enjoy the website.
