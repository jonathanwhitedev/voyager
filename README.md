# Voyager

View my live project here! [voyager]

Voyager is a new website club and newsletter designed to celebrate our unique planet and the thousands of different cultures and traditions each country or territary around the world possesses. This weekly newsletter provides the user with fundamental and educational information on what each country has to offer from inspiration, adventure, travel tips, folklore tales and interviews, religious festivities, amazing food and drinks recipes, and local events. Therefore it remains inclusive for people to be involved without having to travel to featured country. The aim is to provide 1 month of 4 different and vibrant newsletters by sign up, which are emailed to the user to get a varied and informative grasp on each location. These are always fun filled and educational. A new month provides an entirely different and unique country to explore in fabulous detail. Our first month features Iceland.

## User Stories and UX

As part of the UX specification and planning phase it was noted that there are currently no available newsletter websites that offer services to consumers looking for varied inspirational and educational tips of countries around the world in great detail. This was an opening to provide a website that provided a sign up for people. A multitude of people surveyed agreed that there was no website that offered such a vast array of information with a free newsletter, sent weekly via email. This would be something they felt would be a valuable USP. 

Over three quarters of those surveyed (100) also came to agreement there was no one place online that provided inspiration for holidays and trips with such great detail on places to visit, sites to see, unique experiencs to enjoy such as festivities, best times of the year to visit with links to external resources such as travel advice provided by goverment bodies etc.

Another shortfall noticed was that for those who would like to experience a new vibrant culture but were unable to physically travel there, would benefit greatly from recipes and drinks menus and local events happening around the UK that celebrated the culture being displayed for that month. For example Diwali celebrations happening in London, restaurants that serve the most authentic food from that nation with reviews, educational facts and stories of that country that can be read by children and adults alike. Almost all that were surveyed in the UX consulation stage agreed there was no one website that provided all this useful information and more, so readily availabe as Voyager.

Each page on the Voyager website (Home, Spotlight, About, Sign-up and Welcome) keep a clear and modern layout throughout that is accessible for all, gives the user an easy to follow grasp of what the website offers.

A large "Voyager" font in modern text in the centre of the page keeps the attracts the user to the modern lines.

## Testing 

In this section, you need to convince the assessor that you have conducted enough testing to legitimately believe that the site works well. Essentially, in this part you will want to go over all of your project’s features and ensure that they all work as intended, with the project providing an easy and straightforward way for the users to achieve their goals.

In addition, you should mention in this section how your project looks and works on different browsers and screen sizes.

You should also mention in this section any interesting bugs or problems you discovered during your testing, even if you haven't addressed them yet.

If this section grows too long, you may want to split it off into a separate file and link to it from here.

## Credits 

I will firstly credit code institute for the help with this page, the love running project helped me immensely when i found the going tough or needed to remember small details such as how to use social link tags etc. I also want to shout out to the code institute tutors for some help on minor tweaks to point me in directions where i was a little lost and they helped me understand where i was going wrong. Lastly i'd like to thank my dilligent mentor who helped me research other areas such as flexbox and grid, and even told me to start with developing in mobile screens firstly and start backwards from there to desktop. (oh if i had only listened to that last advice, would have saved me so much time!) This was a steep learning curve for me but because of the minor mistakes and not following flex/media at the beginning i learnt the hard way and in turn learnt an awful lot through the stress of it all!

Content and media inspiration is as follows below;

### Content 

- The button anchor tags design sections were taken from finding them on Traversy Media youtube channel and video https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8MgpE2DTTKA&t=1114s these were then redesigned further with colour that was suitable for the page and font/sizes. The same video was also used for finding social li a transform scales to improve look of social icons and pop from page.
- The social icons in the bottom of section of all pages were taken from [Font Awesome](https://fontawesome.com/)
- The webkit stroke function was found after heavy research in needing a solution to allow text to pop off the background to be unique and more readble against the background colours and video content, this was found at (https://css-tricks.com/adding-stroke-to-web-text/) I then incorporated this into my css for my specific needs.

### Media

- All of the videos (5) used on all pages are from This Open Source site (http://pexels.com) these were then resaved as different file names, as text was either in russian or had spaces and would fail testing or reading for other developers.
