# Voyager

View my live project here! [voyager]

Voyager is a new website club and newsletter designed to celebrate our unique planet and the thousands of different cultures and traditions each country or territary around the world possesses. This weekly newsletter provides the user with fundamental and educational information on what each country has to offer from inspiration, adventure, travel tips, folklore tales and interviews, religious festivities, amazing food and drinks recipes, and local events. Therefore it remains inclusive for people to be involved without having to travel to featured country. The aim is to provide 1 month of 4 different and vibrant newsletters by sign up, which are emailed to the user to get a varied and informative grasp on each location. These are always fun filled and educational. A new month provides an entirely different and unique country to explore in fabulous detail. Our first month features Iceland.

## User Stories and UX

As part of the UX specification and planning phase it was noted that there are currently no available newsletter websites that offer services to consumers looking for varied inspirational and educational tips of countries around the world in great detail. This was an opening to provide a website that provided a sign up for people. A multitude of people surveyed agreed that there was no website that offered such a vast array of information with a free newsletter, sent weekly via email. This would be something they felt would be a valuable USP. 

Over three quarters of those surveyed (100) also came to agreement there was no one place online that provided inspiration for holidays and trips with such great detail on places to visit, sites to see, unique experiencs to enjoy such as festivities, best times of the year to visit with links to external resources such as travel advice provided by goverment bodies etc.

Another shortfall noticed was that for those who would like to experience a new vibrant culture but were unable to physically travel there, would benefit greatly from recipes and drinks menus and local events happening around the UK that celebrated the culture being displayed for that month. For example Diwali celebrations happening in London, restaurants that serve the most authentic food from that nation with reviews, educational facts and stories of that country that can be read by children and adults alike. Almost all that were surveyed in the UX consulation stage agreed there was no one website that provided all this useful information and more, so readily availabe as Voyager.

Each page on the Voyager website (Home, Spotlight, About, Sign-up and Welcome) keep a clear and modern layout throughout that is accessible for all, gives the user an easy to follow grasp of what the website offers.

A large "Voyager" font in modern text in the centre of the page keeps the attracts the user to the modern lines. A Small company logo in the top right of the website is also used as a clickable link to get back to the homepage at any point and reamins on all pages. A simple to understand navigation tab also allows user to easily navigate clickable pages. Lastly a footer of the social media links for Voyager is also provided on every page.

## Wireframes

Include images of website as a reponsive mock-up on various screensizes (use resource provided by code ins)

## Testing 

In this section, you need to convince the assessor that you have conducted enough testing to legitimately believe that the site works well. Essentially, in this part you will want to go over all of your project’s features and ensure that they all work as intended, with the project providing an easy and straightforward way for the users to achieve their goals.

In addition, you should mention in this section how your project looks and works on different browsers and screen sizes.

You should also mention in this section any interesting bugs or problems you discovered during your testing, even if you haven't addressed them yet.

If this section grows too long, you may want to split it off into a separate file and link to it from here.


### Validator Testing 

- HTML
  - No errors were returned when passing through the official [W3C validator](https://validator.w3.org/nu/?doc=https%3A%2F%2Fcode-institute-org.github.io%2Flove-running-2.0%2Findex.html)

### Unfixed Bugs

You will need to mention unfixed bugs and why they were not fixed. This section should include shortcomings of the frameworks or technologies used.

- The site was deployed to GitHub pages. The steps to deploy are as follows: 
  - In the GitHub repository, navigate to the Settings tab 
  - From the source section drop-down menu, select the Master Branch

## Other General Project Advice

Below you will find a couple of extra tips that may be helpful when completing your project. Remember that each of these projects will become part of your final portfolio so it’s important to allow enough time to showcase your best work! 

- One of the most basic elements of keeping a healthy commit history is with the commit message. When getting started with your project, read through [this article](https://chris.beams.io/posts/git-commit/) by Chris Beams on How to Write  a Git Commit Message 
  - Make sure to keep the messages in the imperative mood 

- When naming the files in your project directory, make sure to consider meaningful naming of files, point to specific names and sections of content.
  - For example, instead of naming an image used ‘image1.png’ consider naming it ‘landing_page_img.png’. This will ensure that there are clear file paths kept. 

- Do some extra research on good and bad coding practices, there are a handful of useful articles to read, consider reviewing the following list when getting started:
  - [Writing Your Best Code](https://learn.shayhowe.com/html-css/writing-your-best-code/)
  - [HTML & CSS Coding Best Practices](https://medium.com/@inceptiondj.info/html-css-coding-best-practice-fadb9870a00f)
  - [Google HTML/CSS Style Guide](https://google.github.io/styleguide/htmlcssguide.html#General)

Getting started with your Portfolio Projects can be daunting, planning your project can make it a lot easier to tackle, take small steps to reach the final outcome and enjoy the process!
