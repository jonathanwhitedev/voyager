        <p>Bring your cosmic helmet and buckle up, we're taking you on a journey... 
            This is Voyager.
            
            We're an educational travel club sharing our love for the planet, focusing on the culture of a new country every month (with new and exclusive drops weekly upon sign-up). From religious festivities, traditions and customs, travel advice, weekly events in your local city, and mouth watering food and drink inspiration for you to try at home, we want to foster an inclusive world that everyone can enjoy, from the comfort of your homes, to the beaches of Costa Rica, the slopes of the Himalayas and everywhere in-between.
            
            We have you covered.</p>
