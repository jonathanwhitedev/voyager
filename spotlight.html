        <h3>This Months Destination</h3>
        <p>Welcome to the land of ice and fire. A landscape like no other. 
            You could easily be forgiven for imagining you're in the fantasy of JR Tolkien or George R Martin as you discover this enchanting island nation sandwiched between the high seas of the Northern Atlantic and Arctic Oceans. Defined by its dramatic landscapes, shaped by the very volcanoes, glaciers, geysers, hot springs, and lava fields that still shape and mould this Nordic country today, given to the wild for eternity.
            
            In this weeks newsletter we continue on our journey to Iceland with fresh inspiration, to tantalise your tastebuds, change your perspective and to get your dreaming of your next winter getaway, and so much more! </p>
